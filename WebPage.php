            Welcome to my personal website. Here you can find information about me, links to my resume and github, as well as demos of my projects. <br> <br>
            I am currently looking for an internship with a tech or engineering company that will build off of what I have learned in college about programming and working in a team, as well as teach me various new applications for my knowledge, and push me to excel professionally.
